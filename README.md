# NetCDF Viewer for VS Code

**NetCDF Viewer** is a Visual Studio Code extension that lets you explore and inspect NetCDF files (`.nc`, `.nc4`, `.cdf`, `.h5`) directly within your editor. Designed for scientists, engineers, and data analysts, this extension provides a fast, interactive way to browse datasets, view metadata, and preview sample data‚Äîwithout leaving VS Code.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Browse NetCDF files** in a dedicated sidebar tree view
- **Expand dimensions, coordinates, and data variables** just like in xarray
- **View variable attributes and sample data** with a simple click
- **No need for external tools**‚Äîall inspection is done in the editor
- **Python-powered backend** for robust NetCDF parsing

## üìÇ Supported Formats & Limitations
- Works with local NetCDF files: `.nc`, `.nc4`, `.cdf`, `.h5`.
- Primarily tested with NetCDF4/HDF5‚Äîolder NetCDF3 files may not display all metadata.
- Only a small preview of each variable (first ten values) is shown in the tree view.
- Loading extremely large files can take additional time and memory.

2. Open a NetCDF file in the editor.
   - from the Welcome page, click on the "Open NetCDF File" button
   - or right-click a `.nc` file in the Explorer and select **Open in NetCDF Viewer**
   - or use the command palette: `NetCDF Viewer: Open File‚Ä¶`

## üêç Python Requirements

This extension uses Python (via [xarray](https://xarray.dev/) and [netCDF4](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/)) to parse NetCDF files.

**You must have:**

- Python 3.7+
- `xarray` and `netCDF4` installed in your Python environment

If you use a custom Python path, set it in your VS Code settings:

- Select **File > Preferences > Settings** (or `Ctrl+,`)
- Search for `netcdfViewer.pythonPath`
- Set the path to your Python executable:

```markdown
"netcdfViewer.pythonPath": "/path/to/python"
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Open the NetCDF Viewer**  
   Find the **NetCDF Explorer** in the Activity Bar or Side Bar.

2. **Open a NetCDF file**  
   - Right-click a `.nc` file in the Explorer and select **Open in NetCDF Viewer**  
   - Or use the command palette: `NetCDF Viewer: Open File‚Ä¶`

3. **Browse your data**  
   - Expand **Dimensions**, **Coordinates**, and **Data Variables**.
   - Click on a variable to expand and see its attributes and a sample of its data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Packaging

This extension is written in TypeScript and uses a Python script for data extraction.

**To package for VS Code:**

1. Build the extension:

   ```sh
   npm run compile
   ```

2. Package it:

   ```sh
   npx vsce package
   ```

   This will create a `.vsix` file you can install or distribute.

**To install a VSIX:**

```sh
code --install-extension netcdf-viewer-*.vsix
```
